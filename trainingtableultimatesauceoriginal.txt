Hickory Sauce "Original recipe" [Makes 4.5 gallons]:
--------------------------------------------------

1.5 gallons - "Open Pit" Hickory bbq sauce
1/3 cup - Liquid Smoke
1/4 cup - Chili Powder
2 level tablespoons - Cayenne Pepper
3 level tablespoons - Dry Mustard

In a 10 gallon bucket mix well above ingredients - Open Pit, Liquid Smoke, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and mustard. (The 10 gallon bucket makes it easier to stir.  Use the 36" wire whisk to mix before you add the ketchup).

1 Vol-Pak (3 gallons) - Heinz Ketchup

Take the mylar (silver) ba out of box and scrape it with a stainless steel lid. Try not to waste any! Slowly add the ketchup and mix it completely by stirring with a whisk and a spatula. Put a lid on and date it on the side of the bucket.
